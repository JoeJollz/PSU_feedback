Attempted LAN connection. Struggled, yet ping IPAddress was successful, and a 
connected LAN was established, there was a communication blockage between the
computer and QPX750SP. 

In order to find the QPX IP address and TCP/IP Port, follow these steps. 
1. power on the QPX
2. Select Menu -> Interface -> LAN Status -> Next Page.
3. The IP Address of the QPX is shown, along with the Subnet Mask. 
4. With this information. Enter into a browser 'http://{IP_Address}'
5. The following information will be displayed including, TCP/IP Socket Port,
and full Instrument String Address.
was a communication blockage

To address this LAN communication issue, various attempts were trialled.
- Disabling Windows FireWall for Private Ethernet communications.
- Adding a new rule for Windows FireWall Advanced settings for Inbound communication
  (this will require your TCP/IP port number). 
Yet neither resulted in success. Strangely ping {IP address} did show connection was established.

Due to the LAN communication blockage, USB communication was choosen. Via the following steps.
